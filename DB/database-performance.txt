For efficiently querying user trip locations by date ranges and geographic bounds, I would design the following database indexes:

1. Composite Index on Date Range:
CREATE INDEX idx_trip_locations_date ON trip_locations(user_id, timestamp);

This index helps efficiently filter trips by date ranges for a specific user.

2. Spatial Index for Geographic Queries:
CREATE SPATIAL INDEX idx_trip_locations_geo ON trip_locations(coordinates);

This spatial index enables fast geographic boundary queries (e.g. finding all points within a bounding box).

3. Combined Index for Both:
CREATE INDEX idx_trip_locations_combined ON trip_locations(user_id, timestamp, coordinates);

Key considerations:
- The user_id is included first since queries are typically scoped to a specific user
- Timestamp enables range scans for date filtering
- Spatial index handles geographic queries like "find all points within X miles" or "within this map viewport"
- Consider partitioning by user_id if dealing with very large datasets
- Monitor index usage and query performance to validate and tune these indexes

Example table structure:
CREATE TABLE trip_locations (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    coordinates GEOGRAPHY NOT NULL,
    accuracy FLOAT,
    altitude FLOAT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
