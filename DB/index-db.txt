B-tree and GiST indexes serve different purposes in PostgreSQL, particularly for geospatial queries:

B-tree Indexes:
- Optimized for ordered data and equality/range comparisons
- Work well with standard data types like numbers, text, dates
- Not suitable for geospatial data as they can't effectively index multi-dimensional data
- Support only < <= = >= > operators
- Create a balanced tree structure for fast lookups

GiST (Generalized Search Tree) Indexes:
- Designed for complex data types including geometric/spatial data
- Support custom indexing strategies and operators
- Excellent for geospatial queries using PostGIS
- Can handle containment, intersection, proximity queries
- Allow R-tree implementation for spatial indexing

When to use each for geospatial queries:

Use GiST indexes when:
- Working with geometric data types (point, polygon, etc.)
- Need to perform spatial operations (contains, intersects, etc.)
- Using PostGIS extensions
- Doing nearest neighbor searches
- Need to support complex custom operators

Use B-tree indexes when:
- Indexing individual coordinates as simple numbers
- Only need to compare latitude/longitude values directly
- Performing exact matches or range queries on single dimensions
- Need to enforce uniqueness constraints

Example scenarios:
- Finding points within a radius: Use GiST
- Sorting by latitude only: Use B-tree
- Spatial joins: Use GiST
- Point-in-polygon queries: Use GiST
