Implementing Caching for Travel Routes

Several caching strategies can be considered for frequently accessed travel routes:

1. In-Memory Cache (e.g., Redis)
Pros:
- Extremely fast access (microseconds)
- Support for automatic expiration
- Built-in eviction policies
- Distributed caching capability
- Ideal for real-time route lookups

Cons:
- Memory limitations
- Cache invalidation complexity
- Data persistence concerns
- Additional infrastructure cost

2. Database Caching
Pros:
- Persistent storage
- ACID compliance
- Better for large datasets
- Built-in query optimization

Cons:
- Slower than in-memory caching
- Higher resource usage
- More complex to scale

3. CDN Caching
Pros:
- Geographically distributed
- Reduced latency for users
- Handles high traffic well
- Built-in DDoS protection

Cons:
- Higher cost
- Less control over data
- Not ideal for dynamic routes

Example Implementation (Redis):

# Cache key structure
route:{trip_id}:{start_point}:{end_point}

# Example Redis commands
SET route:123:48.8566,2.3522:41.9028,12.4964 "{
    path: [[48.8566,2.3522], [45.4642,9.1900], [41.9028,12.4964]],
    distance: 1422.8,
    duration: 14.5,
    updated: '2023-12-01T10:00:00Z'
}" EX 86400

# Cache lookup
GET route:123:48.8566,2.3522:41.9028,12.4964

# Cache invalidation patterns
DEL route:123:*  # Clear all routes for trip
SCAN route:*     # List all cached routes
EXPIRE route:123:48.8566,2.3522:41.9028,12.4964 3600  # Update TTL

# Batch operations
MSET route:123:* [...multiple routes...]
MGET route:123:* 

# Monitoring
MONITOR           # Watch Redis commands in real-time
INFO commandstats # Get command statistics
