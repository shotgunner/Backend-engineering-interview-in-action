## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Choose Your Path**:
   - For interviews: Start with [System Design](SystemDesign/) and [Data Structures](DataStructures/)
   - For practical skills: Begin with [Python Examples](Python%20Examples/) and [REST](REST/)
   - For architecture: Focus on [Cloud](Cloud/) and [Observability](Observability/)

2. **Setup Development Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/shotgunner/Backend-engineering-interview-in-action.git
   cd Backend-engineering-interview-in-action

   # Set up Python virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows

   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Examples**:
   ```bash
   # Try out the FastAPI example
   cd Python\ Examples/fast-api-example
   uvicorn app:app --reload

   # Run tests
   python -m pytest
   ```
