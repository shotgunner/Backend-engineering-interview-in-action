What is the difference between Task-Qeue (Like Celery) vs Message brokers (Like RabitMq or Kafka) ?

A message broker is like a post office that handles sending and delivering messages (invitations) to different people or systems.
The post office doesn’t care what happens to the invitation after it’s delivered, it just makes sure the message gets to the right person.


A task queue is like a to-do list where workers pick up tasks to do, one by one, until the job is finished.
The workers (task queue) focus on completing tasks one by one, in order, until everything is done.
